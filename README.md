# Annual-Wage-Predictor
This project help employers or job hiring portals to make a best fit between wage and associated parameters.

•	What problem are you solving?
To create a model that will predict annual wages of the people based on various independent parameters available in the data (Categorical and Quantitative). For example: Citizenship status, Education level, Field of degree etc.

•	Why the problem is worth solving/answering
This model will help employers or job hiring portals like Glassdoor, Indeed  to predict right wage for right person based on different parameters (mentioned above).

•	Where can you find data?
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums.html

•	What needs to be done with the data to address the problem?
There are a lot of independent variables and thus many of them will have to be filtered out. Based on a correlation between the parameters, we need to select relevant independent variables.

•	What models can be developed to answer the question, or provide predictions?
Regression Analysis and Linear modeling but based on future analysis, more models will be used.

•	Question: How can you demonstrate the project success?
By breaking the whole project into chunks, like identifying the relevant independent variables, data preparation stage, modeling the data (which models needs to be used), establishing relationship between current data and created model, adding new models and generating some new insights.

•	What resources are required beyond a computer and the internet
Some books may be required to understand the basic concepts of different types of modeling (other than linear modeling) with respect to data and R.
